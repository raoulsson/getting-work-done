What Is Million Dollar Chicken?

Million dollar chicken is a dish inspired by Neiman Marcus Dip, a recipe created by chef Helen Corbit in the 1950s.

At the time she worked at Zodiac, a restaurant inside the flagship Neiman Marcus Store in Dallas, Texas. She was known for her classy food that delivered big flavor, including Neiman Marcus Dip. It was rich and decadent, made with cream cheese, mayonnaise, bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions. Over time it became known as million dollar dip—it was just that good.

Million dollar dip is typically served with crackers as an appetizer, but I knew it would be delicious on chicken.

After running a few experiments, I figured out the best way to create this dish at home. It’s an easy weeknight main that’s sure to go into your regular rotation.
